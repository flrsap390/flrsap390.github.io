<h3>Researches about theory</h3>

- [6_R]({% post_url 2021-10-31-6_R %})

Think and explain in your own words what is the role that probability plays in Statistics and the relation between the observed distribution and frequencies their "theoretical" counterparts. Do some practical examples where you explain how the concepts of an abstract probability space relate to more "concrete" and "real-world" objects when doing statistics.

- 7_R

Explain the Bayes Theorem and its key role in statistical induction. Describe the different paradigs that can be found within statistical inference (such as"bayesian", "frequentist" \[Fisher, Neyman\]).

<h3>Applications / Practice</h3>

- 7_A

Given 2 variables from a csv compute and represent the statistical regression lines (X to Y and viceversa) and the scatterplot.

<h3>Researches about applications</h3>

- 5_RA

Do a web research about the various methods to generate, from a Uniform(\[0,1)), all the most important random variables (discrete and continuous). Collect all source code you think might be useful code of such algorithms (keep credits and attributions wherever applicable), as they will be useful for our next simulations.
