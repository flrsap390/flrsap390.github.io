<b>What is the "Brownian motion" and what is a Wiener process. History, importance, definition and applications (Bachelier, Wiener, Einstein, ...).</b>

The Brownian motion is the random motion of particles suspended in a medium (a liquid or a gas). The Wiener process is a continuous-time stochastic process representing what in physics is called a standard Brownian motion. Both names are often used as synonyms. The standard Brownian motion is a particular case of a generic Brownian motion. As mentioned [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1561353/is-there-a-difference-between-brownian-motion-and-standard-brownian-motion):

“Some authors also use the term "Brownian motion" to refer to translations or scalings of this process; e.g. Bt+x0, which at time t has distribution N(x0,t), or cBt, which has distribution N(0,c2t). So adding the word "standard" serves to clarify when we are not doing that; when we really do mean the process with N(0,t) distribution at time t (i.e. x0=0 and c=1).”

This phenomenon is named after the botanist Robert Brown. In 1827, while looking through a microscope at particles found in pollen grains of size 10−3 cm in water, he noted that the particles moved through the water but was not able to determine the mechanisms that caused their motion. Albert Einstein published a paper in 1905 that explained in precise detail how the motion that Brown had observed was a result of the pollen being moved by individual water molecules. This explanation of Brownian motion served as definitive confirmation that atoms and molecules actually exist, and was further verified experimentally by Jean Perrin in 1908. Perrin was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1926 for his work on the discontinuous structure of matter.

The Wiener process is defined as a stochastic process {Wt}t≥0+ indexed by nonnegative real numbers t with the following properties:

1. W0 = 0.
2. With probability 1, the function t → Wt is continuous in t.
3. The process {Wt}t≥0 has stationary, independent increments.
4. The increment Wt+s − Ws has the NORMAL(0, t) distribution.

The concept of Brownian motion is used in various scientific field, starting from physics, as mentioned above, in the study of the motion of particles in a medium (diffusion of calcium through bones, diffusion of pollutants in the air, motion of electrons in a conductor, etc.), but also in finance (option pricing).
