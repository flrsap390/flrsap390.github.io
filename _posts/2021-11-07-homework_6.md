<h3>Researches about theory</h3>

- [8_R]({% post_url 2021-11-07-8_R %})

Do a research about the following topics:

- The law of large numbers LLN, the various definitions of convergence

- The convergence of the Binomial to the normal and Poisson distributions

- The central limit theorem \[in anticipation of a topic we will study later\]

<h3>Applications / Practice</h3>

Exercise (also partially described in video 04)

Generate and represent m "sample paths" of n point each (m, n are program parameters), where each point represents a pair of:

time index t, and relative frequency of success f(t),

where f(t) is the sum of t Bernoulli random variables with distribution B(x, p) = p^x(1-p)^(1-x) observed at the various times up to t: j=1, ..., t..


At time n (last time) and one other chosen inner time 1<j<n (where j is a user parameter) represent with a histogram the distribution of f(t).

See also what happens if you replace the relative frequency f(t) with the absolute frequency n(t) or by standard relative frequency: (f(t)-p) / sqrt(p(1-p)/t) [ or some "normalized" sum of bernoulli r.v.'s, eg. n(t) / Math.sqrt(t) ].

Comment briefly on the convergence results you see.

<h3>Researches about applications</h3>

- [6_RA] ({% post_url 2021-11-07-6_RA %})

Do a web research about the various methods proposed to compute the running median (one pass, online algorithms).

Store (cite all sources and attributions) the algorithm(s) that you think is(are) a good candidate, explaining briefly how it works and possibly try a quick demo.
