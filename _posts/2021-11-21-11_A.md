<b>Discover a new important stochastic process by yourself! Consider the general scheme we have used so far to simulate some stochastic processes (such as the relative frequency of success in a sequence of trials, the sample mean and the random walk) and now add this new process to our process simulator.</b>

<b>Same scheme as previous program (random walk), except changing the way to compute the values of the paths at each time. Starting from value 0 at time 0, for each of m paths, at each new time compute N(i) = N(i-1) + Random step(i), for i = 1, ..., n, where Random step(i) is now a Bernoulli random variable with success probability equal to λ * (1/n)  (where λ is a user parameter, eg. 50, 100, ...).</b>

<b>At time n (last time) and one (or more) other chosen inner time 1<j<n (j is a program parameter) create and represent with histogram the distribution of N(i). </b>

<b>Represent also the distributions of the following quantities (and any other quantity that you think of interest):</b>

- <b>Distance (time elapsed) of individual jumps from the origin</b>
- <b>Distance (time elapsed) between consecutive jumps (the so-called "holding times")</b>

Here I put the link to download the .zip file containing the code plus a video where I show the execution of the program:
