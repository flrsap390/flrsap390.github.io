<b>4_RA. Do a personal research about the real world window to viewport transformation, and note separately the formulas and code which can be useful for your present and future applications.</b>

Minimum value of variable A -> minimum value of viewport (X coordinate).

Maximum value of variable A -> maximum value of viewport (X coordinate + size of the viewport).

For a certain variable A, we need smallest value and range of values to represent (example: weights represented from 40 kg to 150 kg).

Given a certain value of A we calculate the proportion = (given value â€“ minimum value) / size of the range .

The X coordinate for this given value will be = X coordinate + size of the viewport * proportion .
