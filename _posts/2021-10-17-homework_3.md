<h3>Researches about theory</h3>

- [4_R]({% post_url 2021-10-17-4_R %})

Explain what are marginal, joint and conditional distributions and how we can explain the Bayes theorem using relative frequencies. Explain the concept of statistical independence and why, in case of independence, the relative joint frequencies are equal to the products of the corresponding marginal frequencies.

<h3>Applications / Practice</h3>

- [4_A]({% post_url 2021-10-17-4_A %})

Create a program - in both languages C# and VB.NET (and optionally in js) - to read data from a CSV file, and store it into suitably designed objects, for further processing. Compute mean and standard deviation and frequency distribution for at least one of the variable, and for one pair of variables.

- [5_A]({% post_url 2021-10-17-5_A %})

Compute - in both languages C# and VB.NET (and optionally in js) - a frequency distribution of the meaningful words from any text file and create a personal graphical representation of the corresponding "word cloud" (in case, can use animation if you wish), keeping into account the frequencies of the words.

<h3>Researches about applications</h3>

- [2_RA]({% post_url 2021-10-17-2_RA %})

Do a review about charts useful for statistics and data presentation. What is the chart type that impressed you most and why ?

- [3_RA]({% post_url 2021-10-17-3_RA %})

Do a comprehensive research about the GRAPHICS object and all its members (to get ready to create any statistical chart.)
