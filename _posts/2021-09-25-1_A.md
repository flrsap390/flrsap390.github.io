<b>Create - in both languages C# and VB.NET - a program which does the following simple tasks to get acquainted with the tool:</b>

<b>- when a button is pressed some text appears in a richtexbox on the startup form</b><br>
<b>- when another button is pressed animate one or more balls (possibly of different colors and sizes) within a rectangle</b>


To create this program, first of all I go to the "design" window, I open the toolbox and from there I take and insert inside the Form:

- a richtextbox
- a picturebox
- two buttons (Button1 and Button2)
- a timer

![Form1-design](/images/1_A-Form1-design.png)

Then I create the event handlers for each of them by double-clicking on them, plus I specify a Load event to give some commands to be
executed during the startup of the program.

Also I specify some variables that are used inside those functions. Here are the variables (later I will explain what they are used for):

{% highlight csharp %}
int ball_movex1 = 5, ball_movex2 = 5, ball_movex3 = 5, ball_movey1 = 5, ball_movey2 = 5, ball_movey3 = 5;
int x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3;
Graphics graphics;
Random random = new Random();
Bitmap bitmap;
Rectangle rectangle;
{% endhighlight %}

So first of all, here is the Load function:

{% highlight csharp %}
private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    bitmap = new Bitmap(pictureBox1.Width, pictureBox1.Height);
    graphics = Graphics.FromImage(bitmap);
    rectangle = new Rectangle(0, 0, pictureBox1.Width, pictureBox1.Height);
    graphics.FillRectangle(Brushes.Black, rectangle);

    pictureBox1.Image = bitmap;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here I define a Bitmap object upon which drawings will be done. Then I specify a Graphics object to draw upon the bitmap.
I also specify a Rectangle object, which is used right after to fill the bitmap by coloring it all black using the command
{% highlight csharp %}graphics.FillRectangle(Brushes.Black, rectangle);{% endhighlight %}. Then I finally associate the bitmap
to the Image property of the picturebox, so that it will be displayed.

To do the first task, which is writing some text in a richtextbox, I define the button1_Click event handler this way:

{% highlight csharp %}
private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    this.richTextBox1.AppendText("This is a text.");
}
{% endhighlight %}

Very trivially, this function inserts some text in the richtextbox whenever the button Button1 is clicked.

To do the second task, I use the event handlers for the button Button2 and the timer Timer1. Here is the code for the button2_Click function:

{% highlight csharp %}
private void button2_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (timer1.Enabled == true)
    {
        timer1.Enabled = false;
    }
    else
    {
        int[] factor = { 1, -1 };

        ball_movex1 = ball_movex1 * factor[random.Next() % 2];
        ball_movex2 = ball_movex2 * factor[random.Next() % 2];
        ball_movex3 = ball_movex3 * factor[random.Next() % 2];
        ball_movey1 = ball_movey1 * factor[random.Next() % 2];
        ball_movey2 = ball_movey2 * factor[random.Next() % 2];
        ball_movey3 = ball_movey3 * factor[random.Next() % 2];

        x1 = random.Next(pictureBox1.Width - 20);
        y1 = random.Next(pictureBox1.Height - 20);
        graphics.FillEllipse(System.Drawing.Brushes.Blue, x1, y1, 20, 20);
        x2 = random.Next(pictureBox1.Width - 20);
        y2 = random.Next(pictureBox1.Height - 20);
        graphics.FillEllipse(System.Drawing.Brushes.Red, x2, y2, 20, 20);
        x3 = random.Next(pictureBox1.Width - 20);
        y3 = random.Next(pictureBox1.Height - 20);
        graphics.FillEllipse(System.Drawing.Brushes.Yellow, x3, y3, 20, 20);

        timer1.Enabled = true;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here I draw 3 balls inside the picturebox. To do this I set the values for the xn and yn variables with random values indicating the initial position of those
balls. Also, I have defined the variables ball_movexn and ball_moveyn that represent the displacement of the balls along the X and Y axis at each tick of
the timer (for example, ball_movex1 = 5 has to be interpreted as "at each tick of the timer, the first ball moves 5 pixels right", while ball_movey1 = 5
means "at each tick of the timer, the first ball moves 5 pixels down"). Before enabling the timer, I also randomize the direction these balls will be
going by randomically multiplying them either by 1 or -1. These are all the actions done when the timer is not enabled. If it already is enabled, it
disables it.

Here is the code for the timer1_Tick event handler:

{% highlight csharp %}
private void timer1_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    graphics.FillRectangle(Brushes.Black, rectangle);

    if (x1 <= 0 || (x1 + 20) >= pictureBox1.ClientSize.Width) ball_movex1 = ball_movex1 * -1;
    if (x2 <= 0 || (x2 + 20) >= pictureBox1.ClientSize.Width) ball_movex2 = ball_movex2 * -1;
    if (x3 <= 0 || (x3 + 20) >= pictureBox1.ClientSize.Width) ball_movex3 = ball_movex3 * -1;
    if (y1 <= 0 || (y1 + 20) >= pictureBox1.ClientSize.Height) ball_movey1 = ball_movey1 * -1;
    if (y2 <= 0 || (y2 + 20) >= pictureBox1.ClientSize.Height) ball_movey2 = ball_movey2 * -1;
    if (y3 <= 0 || (y3 + 20) >= pictureBox1.ClientSize.Height) ball_movey3 = ball_movey3 * -1;
    
    x1 += ball_movex1;
    x2 += ball_movex2;
    x3 += ball_movex3;
    y1 += ball_movey1;
    y2 += ball_movey2;
    y3 += ball_movey3;

    graphics.FillEllipse(System.Drawing.Brushes.Blue, x1, y1, 20, 20);
    graphics.FillEllipse(System.Drawing.Brushes.Red, x2, y2, 20, 20);
    graphics.FillEllipse(System.Drawing.Brushes.Yellow, x3, y3, 20, 20);

    pictureBox1.Image = bitmap;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here, at each tick, the function initially resets the bitmap to an empty black rectangle with the command
{% highlight csharp %}graphics.FillRectangle(Brushes.Black, rectangle);{% endhighlight %}. Then it checks if the balls collide with the borders of
the picturebox. If it does, it complements the value of ball_movexn/ball_moveyn by multiplying it by -1, so that it will bounce back and move in the
opposite direction. Then the values of the coordinates (xn,yn) are incremented adding ball_movexn and ball_moveyn respectively (decremented if those
values are negative). Then the balls are redrawn with the updated values and finally they are displayed with the command
{% highlight csharp %}pictureBox1.Image = bitmap;{% endhighlight %}.



Here I put the link to download the code of the program (written in both C# and VB.net) plus a video where I show the execution of the program.
