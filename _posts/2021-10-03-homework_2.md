<h3>Researches about theory</h3>

- [3_R]({% post_url 2021-10-09-3_R %})

Show how we can obtain an online algo for the arithmetic mean and explain the various possible reasons why it is preferable to the "naive" algo based on the definition.

<h3>Applications / Practice</h3>

- [2_A]({% post_url 2021-10-09-2_A %})

Create - in both languages C# and VB.NET - a demonstrative program which computes the online arithmetic mean (if it's a numeric variable) and your own algo to compute the distribution for a discrete variable and for a continuous variable (can use values simulated with RANDOM object).

Create an object providing a rectangular area which can be moved and resized using the mouse. This area will hold our future charts and graphics.
