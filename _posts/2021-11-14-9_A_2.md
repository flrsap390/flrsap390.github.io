<b>Generate sample paths of jump processes which at each time considered t = 1, ..., n perform jumps computed as:</b>

<b>-   σ R(t)  (and/or divide by sqrt(1/t) in case you want to make constant the variance at each time by "normalizing" the sum, or divide by sqrt(1/n) in order to obtain standard deviation = σ at last time [the so called "scaling limit"])
where R(t)  is a \[-1,1\] Rademacher random variable (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rademacher_distribution).</b>

<b>-  σ Z(t), where  Z(t) is a N(0,1) random variable (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)</b>

<b>(and/or divide by sqrt(1/t)  in case you want to make constant the variance at each time by "normalizing" the sum, or divide by sqrt(1/n) in order to obtain standard deviation = σ at last time )</b>

<b>and see what happens as n (simulation parameter, denoting the number of jumps, or subdivision in the "scaling limit") becomes larger.</b>

<b>\[As before, at time n (last time) and one other chosen inner time 1<j<n (j is a program parameter) create and represent with histogram the distribution of the process \]</b>




Here I put the link to download the .zip file containing the code plus a video where I show the execution of the program:
