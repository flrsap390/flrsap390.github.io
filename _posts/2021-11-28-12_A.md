<b>Discover one of the most important stochastic process by yourself !</b>

<b>Consider the general scheme we have used so far to simulate stochastic processes (such as the relative frequency of success in a sequence of trials, the sample mean, the random walk, the Poisson point process, etc.) and now add this new process to our simulator.</b>

<b>Starting from value 0 at time 0, for each of m paths, at each new time compute P(t) = P(t-1) + Random step(t), for t = 1, ..., n, where the Random step(t) is now:</b>

<b>σ * sqrt(1/n) * Z(t),</b>

<b>where  Z(t) is a N(0,1) random variable (the "diffusion" σ is a user parameter, to scale the process dispersion).</b>

<b>At time n (last time) and one (or more) other chosen inner time 1<j<n (j is a program parameter) create and represent with histogram the distribution of P(t). Observe the behavior of the process for large n.</b>

Here I put the link to download the .zip file containing the code plus a video where I show the execution of the program:
