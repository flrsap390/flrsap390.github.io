<b>Given a random variable, extract m samples of size n and plot the empirical distribution of its mean (histogram), the first and the last order statistics. Comment on what you see.</b>

(
- valori tendono a concentrarsi pi√π vicini alla media teorica all'aumentare di n.
- valori tendono a disperdersi maggiormente quando m si avvicina allo 0, quando si avvicina a n e con valori superiori
a n, mentre tendono a concentrarsi verso la media per valori intermedi.
)

After executing a few computations, trying different values for m and n, these are the things I noticed:

- values tend to converge more towards the theoretical mean as n increases
- values tend to diverge as m gets closer to 0, as m gets closer to n and for higher values, while they tend to converge for intermediate values

Regarding the CDF of the first and last order statistics, their graphical representations show the difference in the way the probabilities are distributed. In particular the distribution function for the first order statistics is more skewed towards the left, while in the case of the last order statistics it is skewed towards the right.

Here I put the link to download the .zip file containing the code plus a video where I show the execution of the program:
