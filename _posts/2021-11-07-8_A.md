<b>Exercise (also partially described in video 04)

Generate and represent m "sample paths" of n point each (m, n are program parameters), where each point represents a pair of:

time index t, and relative frequency of success f(t),

where f(t) is the sum of t Bernoulli random variables with distribution B(x, p) = p^x(1-p)^(1-x) observed at the various times up to t: j=1, ..., t..


At time n (last time) and one other chosen inner time 1<j<n (where j is a user parameter) represent with a histogram the distribution of f(t).

See also what happens if you replace the relative frequency f(t) with the absolute frequency n(t) or by standard relative frequency: (f(t)-p) / sqrt(p(1-p)/t) \[ or some "normalized" sum of bernoulli r.v.'s, eg. n(t) / Math.sqrt(t) \].

Comment briefly on the convergence results you see.</b>
