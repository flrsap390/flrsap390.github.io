<b>Try to find on the web what are the names of the random variables that you just simulated in the applications, and see if the means and variances that you obtain in the simulation are compatible with the "theory". If not fix the possible bugs.</b>

- Realizations taken from exp(N(0,1))): log-normal distribution
- Realizations taken from N(0,1) squared: Chi-squared distribution
- Realizations taken from a (squared N(0,1)) divided by another (squared N(0,1)): F-distribution
