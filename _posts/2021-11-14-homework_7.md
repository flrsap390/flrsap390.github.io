<h3>Researches about theory</h3>

History and derivation of the normal distribution. Touch, at least, the following three i mportant perspectives, putting them into an historical context to understand how  the idea developed:

1. as approximation of binomial (De Moivre)
2. as error curve (Gauss)
3. as limit of sum of independent r.v.'s (Laplace)

<h3>Applications / Practice</h3>

- [9_A_1]({% post_url 2021-11-14-9_A_1 %})

Create a simulation with graphics to convince yourself of the uniform convergence of the empirical CDF to the theoretical distribution (Glivenko-Cantelli theorem). You may use a simple random variable of your choice for such a demonstration.

- [9_A_2]({% post_url 2021-11-14-9_A_2 %})

Generate sample paths of jump processes which at each time considered t = 1, ..., n perform jumps computed as:

-   σ R(t)  (and/or divide by sqrt(1/t) in case you want to make constant the variance at each time by "normalizing" the sum, or divide by sqrt(1/n) in order to obtain standard deviation = σ at last time \[the so called "scaling limit"\])
where R(t)  is a \[-1,1\] Rademacher random variable (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rademacher_distribution).

-  σ Z(t), where  Z(t) is a N(0,1) random variable (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)

(and/or divide by sqrt(1/t)  in case you want to make constant the variance at each time by "normalizing" the sum, or divide by sqrt(1/n) in order to obtain standard deviation = σ at last time )

and see what happens as n (simulation parameter, denoting the number of jumps, or subdivision in the "scaling limit") becomes larger.

<h3>Researches about applications</h3>

- [7_RA]({% post_url 2021-11-14-7_RA %})

Do a research about the random walk process and its properties. Compare your finding with your applications drawing your personal conclusions. Explain based on your exercise the beaviour of the distribution of the stochastic process (check out "Donsker's invariance principle"). What are, in particular, its mean and variance at time n ?
