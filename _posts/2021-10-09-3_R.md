<b>3_R. Show how we can obtain an online algo for the arithmetic mean and explain the various possible reasons why it is preferable to the "naive" algo based on the definition.</b>

The calculation of the average is something we learn in school when we are very young, and everyone nowadays knows the formula:

Not many people know that there exists an alternative formula to calculate the arithmetic mean, which is probably something most people would not care about, because until one has to deal with a small amount of relatively small numbers it does not make much difference which formula is used, so long as the results are correct. But from a computer scientist perspective using this formula makes a big difference.

Let’s make an example of mean calculation. Suppose you’re a bank (a big one, like J.P. Morgan or something like that) and you want to know the average amount of money in all the bank accounts of your clients. That makes a lot of big numbers to deal with. Now imagine a computer taking billions of big numbers all together to make a calculation, and imagine the big number that has to be divided.

A good computer scientist understands that this is not feasible. The most evident reason is inefficiency, because of all the computational resources needed to do such a calculation. Another problem (in many case even more important) is computational errors due to floating point issues. Since we’re doing many additions and the representation of the numbers in computers is not always precise, this could lead to the so called “error propagation”, which in turn can lead to faulty values. If this bad when doing so called “offline” processing or batch processing, it’s even worse when doing real-time calculations, where we have to repeat the same process periodically when new data comes in.

The alternative formula does not need to have all the values stored in memory, but just three:  an already calculated average, the new value and the total number of values. This is the formula:

This formula is the best to use in online algorithms for stream processing, but it is applicable also for batch processing. This avoids having to deal with exaggeratedly large numbers.
