<b>Create the a distribution representation (histogram, or CDF ...) to represent the following:</b>

<b>- Realizations taken from a Normal(0,1)</b>

<b>- Realizations of the mean, obtained by averaging several times (say m times, m large) n of the above realizations</b>

<b>- Realizations of the variance, obtained by averaging several times (say m times, m large) n of the above realizations</b>

<b>- Realizations taken from exp(N(0,1)))</b>

<b>- Realizations taken from N(0,1) squared</b>

<b>- Realizations taken from a (squared N(0,1)) divided by another (squared N(0,1))</b>

Here I put the link to download the .zip file containing the code plus a video where I show the execution of the program:
