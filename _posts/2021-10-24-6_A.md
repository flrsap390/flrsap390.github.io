<b>6_A. Prepare separately the following charts: 1) Scatterplot, 2) Histogram/Column chart \[in the histogram, within each class interval, draw also a vertical colored line where lies the true mean of the observations falling in that class\] and 3) Contingency table, using the graphics object and its methods (Drawstring(), MeasureString(), DrawLine(), etc).
Use them to represent 2 numerical variables that you select from a CSV file. In particular, in the same picture box, you will make at least 2 separate charts: 1 dynamic rectangle will contain the contingency table, and 1 rectangle (chart) will contain the scatterplot, with the histograms/column charts and rug plots drawn respectively near the two axis (and oriented accordingly).</b>
