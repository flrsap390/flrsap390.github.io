<b>An "analog" of the CLT for stochastic process: the standard Wiener process as "scaling limit" of a random walk and the functional CLT (Donsker theorem) or invariance principle. Explain the intuitive meaning of this result and how you have already illustrated the result in your homework.</b>

The Central Limit Theorem states that "when independent random variables are summed up, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution (informally a bell curve) even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed", and this convergence in distribution happens "as $$n \to \infty$$". 

The Donskerâ€™s theorem extends this principle, starting by identifying this sum of n i.i.d. variables as the final result of the Wiener process ($$W^{(n)}$$) applied on variables with mean 0 and variance 1. In this case, "Donsker's invariance principle extends this convergence to the whole function $$W^{(n)}:=(W^{(n)}(t))_{t \in [0,1]}$$".

This principle is shown in application 12_A. Here we had to draw histograms of the values obtained both at the end of the process and at one or more intermediate points. As the results show, the distribution of the results at any point in time correspond approximatively to a Gaussian distribution.
