<b>Think and explain in your own words what is the role that probability plays in Statistics and the relation between the observed distribution and frequencies their "theoretical" counterparts. Do some practical examples where you explain how the concepts of an abstract probability space relate to more "concrete" and "real-world" objects when doing statistics.</b>

When we try to define probabilities, the most common way to do it is by looking at patterns occurring in past events, and from this knowledge we will not get any certainty but rather a certain confidence that betting on one event is more convenient than doing so for another one. In essence, probabilities try to define an hypothetical frequency distribution for empirical evidences we don’t have yet, with the goal of minimizing the difference between this theoretical distribution and the real one. For example, if we know that in the last period (let’s say in the last month) 1 over 5 people got fever because of COVID-19, we could predict that between the next 1000 people that will get fever 200 will have it because of COVID while the other 800 will have it for other reasons. But then let’s say that a new, more contagious variant will come out. That doesn’t mean that the frequency distribution for the next 1000 people will necessarily be different from the previous one, but knowing that the power of contagion for this variant is higher we can deduce that there are some situations in which the old variant wouldn’t have been able to reach a healthy person and infect him while the new one instead would be capable to do so, and we can be led to think that the ratio of sick people who got fever because of this virus will be higher.
