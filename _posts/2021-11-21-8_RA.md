<b> Find out on the web what you have just generated in the previous application. Can you find out about all the well known distributions that "naturally arise" in this process?</b>

The type of distribution generated by the program of exercise 11_A is a Poisson distribution, and the process that generates it is called a Poisson process. A Poisson process describes events that appear to happen at a certain rate, but completely at random, like the event that an earthquake occur in a certain area. The distribution of the probabilities of the events associated to a Poisson process is the Poisson distribution. Its probability mass function gives the probability of observing k events in a time period given the length of the period and the average events per time:

![Poisson-distribution-probability-function](/images/8_RA-Poisson-distribution-probability-function.png)

Where $$\lambda = \frac{\text{events}}{\text{time}}*\text{time period}$$

Speaking of the assigned exercise, this formula can be applied to the case of the “jumps from origin”. In fact, given the result of one of such executions, we can use this formula to compute the probability for this event to occur.
