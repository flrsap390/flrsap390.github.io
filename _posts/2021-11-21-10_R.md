<b>Distributions of the order statistics: look on the web for the most simple (but still rigorous) and clear derivations of the distributions, explaining in your own words the methods used.</b>

From <a href="https://probabilityandstats.wordpress.com/2010/02/20/the-distributions-of-the-order-statistics/">here</a>:

"The distribution function of $$Y_i$$ is an upper tail of a binomial distribution. If the event $$Y_i \le y$$ occurs, then there are at least i many $$X_j$$ in the sample that are less than or equal to $$y$$. Consider the event that $$X \le y$$ as a success and $$F(y)=P[X \le y]$$ as the probability of success. Then the drawing of each sample item becomes a Bernoulli trial (a success or a failure). We are interested in the probability of having at least $$i$$ many successes. Thus the following is the distribution function of $$Y_i$$:"

In simple words, we consider all the possible cases where $$X \le y$$. The first one is the case where $$i$$ many $$X_j$$ in the sample are less than or equal to $$y$$, so we have all possible combinations of $$i$$ elements before $$x$$ and $$n-i$$ elements after $$x$$. Then  we consider the case where $$i+1$$ values are before $$x$$ and $$n-i-1$$ fall after $$x$$ and so on up to the case where all the values are smaller than $$x$$.
