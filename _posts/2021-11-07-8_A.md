<b>Exercise (also partially described in video 04)</b>

<b>Generate and represent m "sample paths" of n point each (m, n are program parameters), where each point represents a pair of:</b>

<b>time index t, and relative frequency of success f(t),</b>

<b>where f(t) is the sum of t Bernoulli random variables with distribution B(x, p) = p^x(1-p)^(1-x) observed at the various times up to t: j=1, ..., t..</b>


<b>At time n (last time) and one other chosen inner time 1<j<n (where j is a user parameter) represent with a histogram the distribution of f(t).</b>

<b>See also what happens if you replace the relative frequency f(t) with the absolute frequency n(t) or by standard relative frequency: (f(t)-p) / sqrt(p(1-p)/t) \[ or some "normalized" sum of bernoulli r.v.'s, eg. n(t) / Math.sqrt(t) \].</b>

<b>Comment briefly on the convergence results you see.</b>

The description of the code can be found in comments inside the code itself.

Looking at the results we can see that the higher is the number of points for each experiment (so, for each sample path) and the more the results will converge to the average. This average is given by max_value \* p (where p is the probability of success and max_value is n for the absolute frequency and 1 for the relative frequency).

Here I put the link to download the .zip file containing the code plus a video where I show the execution of the program:
